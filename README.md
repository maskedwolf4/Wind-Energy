# Wind-Energy


**# Wind Energy Prediction App**

**## Overview**

This application leverages a machine learning model to predict the power generated by wind turbines based on various weather conditions. It's built with Python and Streamlit, offering an intuitive interface for easy exploration.

**## Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maskedwolf4/Wind-Energy.git
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/macOS)
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # (Windows)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**## Usage**

1. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run weapp.py
   ```

2. **Enter weather conditions in the sidebar:**
   - Temperature (2m)
   - Relative Humidity (2m)
   - Dew Point (2m)
   - Wind Speed (10m)
   - Wind Speed (100m)
   - Wind Direction (10m)
   - Wind Direction (100m)
   - Wind Gusts (10m)

3. **Click "Predict Power" to generate the prediction.**
